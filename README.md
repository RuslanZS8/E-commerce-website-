💡 My Role: Frontend Developer
As one of the Frontend Developers, my focus was on building a fast, interactive user interface using pure JavaScript.

I implemented the core UI components without the "crutch" of frameworks, ensuring deep compatibility and fast load times.

I worked closely with the backend team to integrate API endpoints for the shopping and calculation modules.

I helped maintain our Kanban board to ensure we met our 14-day deadline.
